This is my first E-commerce website.

This is an actual project I'm working on, There will be many updates coming soon.



Updates to look for are :

1- Payment gateway
2- Better product display inside categories and on the main page also.
3- There will be JS implementation for better experience.
4- Will add responsivenes to different device sizes.
5- Bootstrap implementation
6- Cart items count on the cart icon.
7- Contact us page
8- Will create some bugs to fix later :D





Notes:

- You will be able to make a puchase without actually having to go through billing and payments forms.
- I listed the same prices to save sometimes (Of course that will be changed in production).
